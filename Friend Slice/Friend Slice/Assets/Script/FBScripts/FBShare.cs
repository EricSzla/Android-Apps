// Class responsible for Facebook Sharing in Friend Smash!
//
// In the Unity version of Friend Smash sharing is used for two purposes:
// Publishing scores using Scores API and sharing a completed game using the Share Dialog.
// For more details on sharing games content to Facebook see: https://developers.facebook.com/docs/games/sharing
// For more details on the Scores API see: https://developers.facebook.com/docs/games/scores
//

    //
    // This is a sharing flow that allows players to brag about their success in the game.
    // By letting players share content, your game becomes visible to their friends in their newsfeeds,
    // which is an important source of new traffic to your game.
    //
    // Unlike the API-based sharing using FB.ShareLink or FB.FeedShare to call the Share Dialog does NOT require
    // extra publish_actions permissions.
